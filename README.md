### Explode

Breaking a sentence into words based on the space between words

### Ideas
- I converted the sentence characters into bytes
- I track the words with two indexes starting from the string length
- I return the words, the the remaining will be the final word


### Next [TODO]
- [ ] Returning an array of the extracted words
- [x] ~~ Define the words separator (not just the space) ~~
